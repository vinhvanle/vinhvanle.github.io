        <h2>Robots</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">    Humans for centuries have been trying to improve their quality of life through many means. One of those means is reducing human labor in almost everything. In order to achieve that purpose, humans invented helpers that resemble a human’s form that can do certain tasks. Humans have successfully created machines that carry part of the human’s form or the whole human’s body that can replace humans in some operations automatically. Those machines are called robots. Humans had created many robots that can do tasks by themselves since ancient times. For example, in the 10th century BC in the Western Zhou Dynasty, an artisan named Yan Shi created a puppet that has a human form that could sing and dance. To the modern-day, the robot that is humanoid and has state of the art technology is Honda Motor Corporation’s Asimo. Asimo can perform human activities such as walking, climbing stairs, waving,... Robots like Asimo are created with the purpose of helping human’s everyday life. There are also other robots that were created to perform one single task such as drawing, boxing, talking. The advancement of these robots is very impressive in terms of how well it can do the assigned tasks. In the near future, we can expect a world where robots are in every home helping with simple tasks. Moreover, there will be automated factories where minimal human supervision is required that can achieve high efficiency. Those factories will help minimize human life lost to workplace accidents. Robots can also be used in dangerous tasks such as rescuing people in fires or in any kind of catastrophes. Robotic developments will always go hand in hand with the advancement of Artificial Intelligence technology. Combining those two areas, humans will be able to create fully automated robots that can learn and improve in the process. The robots will be able to learn what is the best course of action for the specific situation and devise a plan or actions that minimize the risks for humans as well as themselves. There are already self-driving cars that are on the market that can help reduce the commuting troubles as well as human life lost due to traffic accidents. 
        </p>
        <p style ="text-indent: 40px">    Robots will no doubt become one essential aspect of human life in the near future due to their wide range of applications. Robots can be used in virtually every single aspect of life, from entertainment to healthcare, or even fightings. Robots can be used in the entertainment industry for purposes such as controlling the stage set or performing. As I said before, robots are created for the purpose of replacing human labor, therefore, any tasks that humans can do, a robot created for that specific task will be able to perform as well or even better than humans. Robots can also be used in healthcare in a way that they can perform minor surgeries or even major surgeries with surgical precision and accuracy, thus they can reduce the human error factor from those surgeries. Robots can also be used in wartime so that soldiers won’t have to risk their lives in defusing bombs or recon. Robots can also be used in controlling traffics or other operations that require stability and logic. With the help of robots, humans can deduct the human error factor out of the equation for everything. The application of robots can help bring the efficiency of everything up by a lot while reducing the human force needed to operate things. This will certainly reduce the number of jobs by a lot, but for a better quality of life for humans.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-indent: 40px">    In my daily life, with the help of robots or automated technologies, I will be able to spend less time on small tasks such as cleaning houses, doing chores, and such, so I can focus on more important matters, bringing my efficiency up by a lot in doing anything. Moreover, with the help of robots, the society I live in will be less chaotic and become more stable as everything is kept in line by the robots. Accidents will happen less, me and my family members will be able to have a more secure life knowing robots are always doing their best with keeping the orders. However, if robots are replacing the human force, some of my family members won’t be able to work anymore, and they’re over the age of learning the technology of robots so they will have a harder time adjusting.

        <h2>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys, and other small computing devices
        </h2>
        <p style = "text-indent: 40px">    In my project, I used an Arduino microcontroller. There are other microcontrollers that serve the same purpose as Arduinos such as Rasberry Pis or Makey Makeys. Those microcontrollers enable people to do basic projects to advanced projects. The limit is only the human’s imagination. There are already a lot of fascinating projects created by users all around the globe. Simple robots to advanced robots that can do tasks on their own or controlled in sophisticated ways such as motion-controlled or remote-controlled. There are also projects that works for security purposed such as fingerprint-activated locks or simple home security systems that help monitor any suspicious activities within the vicinity. The Arduino microcontroller is very popular with anyone that is just starting to learn electronics or robotics. This is a very powerful tool that can provide various approaches to any ideas that the users have. Due to its high capability in providing components that serve many different purposes such as sensors or processors, or its capability in connecting with each other or with the internet or any other devices, this tool is the go-to option for almost every developer or inventors. For a long time, these microcontrollers have served as learning tools or developing tools for everyone, from beginners to advanced professionals. Arduino, Raspberry Pie, Makey Makey, or any other small computing devices can be the tool to apply many aspects of IT such as Artificial Intelligence, autonomous vehicles, Machine Learning, Robots,... 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">    The potential impacts of these small computing devices are great. The perfect demonstration of that is the number of projects that are upload online for learning purposes. Moreover, these small computing devices are the stepping stone or the main inspirations for bigger machines that can do the task more sophistically. Arduino, Raspberry Pie, Makey Makey has been the best learning and experiment tools since the day they became available for society. For those learning tools, the potentials changes can only be of that more components are provided, adding the range of ideas or projects that can be done using those microcontrollers. Students or beginners will be able to learn and do more using these tools. Advanced users will be able to devise experiments or prototypes using Arduino, Raspberry Pie or Makey Makey. 
        </p>
        <p style ="text-indent: 40px">    Arduino, Microbits, Raspberry Pie has been my go-to tools for any projects that I have in mind. The simplicity and unity of these small computing devices have been very helpful for my learning process and also for my executing ideas process. Using these tools, I will be able to also teach my family and friends IT or just electronics in general. The potentials these devices bring will be here forever since there will be no better learning tools I believe.
