          “Your project idea is very possible and brings a very high potential. I think the purpose and the functions you listed are very practical. It is also very doable. The knowledge needed for also doable for beginners. You can maybe improve it so that it can move through different terrains to make it more useful.”

          “I think you have a really good project idea. It covers IoT and also the robot aspect. The cost for this project is low so it is very realistic. There are a lot of similar products that are already on the market. However, you can add more functions to the robot such as constantly recording video to give the users better security.”

          I think both feedbacks are positive to my project idea. This confirms my statement that this project is very realistic and doable. They both agree that my robot can be a good addition to the home security system. Moreover, those feedbacks also pointed out some things that I can do to improve my project, such as: making it more adaptable to different terrain situations or giving it the ability to constantly do video-surveillance around the house. Those feedbacks give me some more ideas to improve my project. For example, I can add the sound function to it to notify anyone that is in the vicinity in case of any emergency. The feedbacks that I received are very useful. I think I will need to get more feedbacks from other people to get their opinions on how I can further improve my project for the future. For the time being, I will base on what I have already received and develop my project in that way. Later on, I will ask for more feedbacks and then I can improve my robot even further.
