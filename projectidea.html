        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p style ="text-indent: 40">
          My project will be building a smart car model using Arduino. This smart car will be able to follow a trail that is already set up and also avoid obstacles in the path. This car can be remotely controlled through Bluetooth with smartphones and also set to autopilot. This project is an example of IoT, which is a very important aspect of IT. The car will be able to detect everything through sensors such as proximity sensors, heat sensors, or light sensors. This project also requires knowledge in coding as well as hardware connection. This can be further developed into a security guard for the house in case of fire by adding fire and smoke sensors. The car can be set to patrol around the house automatically, in case of fire or any hazardous situation, a notification will be sent to the owner’s smartphone as a precaution and also a notification to the authorities.

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p style ="text-indent: 40">
          I got my inspiration from the contest of Robocon that takes place in Vietnam every year. In that contest, contestants will build small robots that can do certain tasks that are asked by the judges. “During this five-year period, US fire departments responded to an estimated average of 353,100 home structure fires per year. These fires caused an annual average of 2,620 civilian deaths; 11,030 civilian fire injuries; and $7.2 billion in direct property damage.”(Home Structure Fires 2020) Because the amount of home structure fires every year is very high, this robot can help to minimize that number by quick actions. This can be a cheap precaution for home-owners because Arduino is cheap and useful. Moreover, I am learning Arduino in another course so I can also practice with Arduino.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style ="text-indent: 40">
          The “Home-guard pal” will be a cost-efficient home protecting robot for every home. “Home-guard pal” will make sure when you leave your home you have the confidence of knowing immediately if anything’s wrong with your beloved home. Using the Arduino single-board microcontroller as the brain, along with sensors that are built for Arduino such as proximity sensors, light sensors, heat sensors, and smoke sensors, “Home-guard pal” will be able to patrol and protect your house from fires as well as water leaks and so on. With cheap components, this can be the ideal choice for any family with high or low income. “Home-guard pal” can move in a set patrol path throughout the house and also detect and avoid obstacles on the path, if there happen to be any. Therefore, it can work tirelessly and efficiently in any house structure. ‘Home-guard pal” is able to do this because of the light and proximity sensor. It will detect the path by looking for a specific path with a specific color set up by the user. The sensor will constantly update values and send them to the controller to adjust the speed or course of the whole robot. The proximity sensor will also work hand in hand with the light sensor to detect any obstacle on the set path and correct the robot accordingly. 
        </p>
        <p style ="text-indent: 40">
          While the robot makes its way around the path, the heat sensors, humidity sensors, or smoke sensor will also constantly check the environment for any anomalies and send that information to the controller to process and analyze. If the amount of smoke or the temperature of the room is over the threshold, the emergency mode will be triggered. A notification will be sent to the owner’s phone as well as the authorities for the quick response and minimize the damage done to the properties as well as human life, potentially. The threshold is set by the producers and can be modified by the user due to different geographic or environmental differences. 
        </p>
        <p style ="text-indent: 40">
          The robot can use batteries so that it doesn’t run into any trouble with the wires. Moreover, we can add a mini solar panel on its back to constantly charge the batteries and improve the robot’s runtime. Moreover, the robot can be upgraded to do more things by adding sensors or adding connectivity functions such as calling or recording and sending footage of the hazard. The potential for this little project is great but at a cheap cost.

        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <p style ="text-indent: 40">
          The main coding tool for this project will be the Arduino IDE which is provided free for users by Arduino. The coding language is C. Arduino is an open-sourced hardware which is a microcontroller. The sensors are also provided by Arduino. A car base with wheels and servos and also mounting plates for sensors and the microcontroller are needed. Wires and batteries are also needed to power the robot.

        <h2>Skills required</h2>
        <p style ="text-indent: 40">
          The skills needed for this project are C language programming language. Moreover, hardware connections are also needed so some electrical knowledge is needed. Some mechanical engineering knowledge would be very helpful in the process of putting parts of the robot together and achieve a good balance for the robot in terms of weight, aerodynamics, and also energy usage. These skills are only the basic knowledge of learning IT in RMIT so that would not be a problem. Moreover, the hardware is sold online at a cheap price and very accessible to anyone.

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p style ="text-indent: 40">
          If the project is successful, this could be a new cheap home safety equipment for everyone with high or low income. This little robot can help minimize the damages to properties as well as human life during any home structure hazard such as fire due to its routine activities and quick response to any environmental anomalies. This project can help improve the quality of life for everyone in the future as it brings confidence to the owner when having to leave the house unattended.
